## Lyrics

```
Feeling wrong with all the words been spitting out yeah
Fleeting thoughts are the swarms I've been calling down (to?)
Give it up I've told myself perhaps a thousand times yeah 
Counting blows like they are mine, no intention to put up 

Truth be told lack of progress is what scares me most
Leading home another kind of route I'm taking off 
the road so long as you don't listen, you just cope yeah
Feeding hope wasn't all that wise - nope

Now I get to know the new horizons - such a trope
All was sort of well before you came along  (so)
Glad I lied to myself I was wrong (wrathed?)
Now I realize (?) I am here (in red) -with- only dust and lasers and me alone
In my head, always there, always sorta broke but strong
Bowing head up in arms, destitute but gold
Turning rage into cold (brew)
Ain't rich (ain't shit) according to y'all but that's fine 
Coz (it) that ain't my mode of thought

look at you all so serene during calm before the storm

You think my
Morals gone, you think, fine, i think just refined yeah 
Looking for sublime manifesting 
Trance with bass to lasers so defines the rhymes (lasers like rhymes)  precise
devise 
perspectives colorized when many clash with one
What inside you can't see is the prize
Maybe take just a peek sometimes
You prolly be suprised with what you're missing out


Oh I know I've put barriers against my better judgement
Trying out but those new facade —  aaah

...





need another half - no repeating, just narrative

```

## Notes

## Music Video

Definicja Hitech Crime: „now i realize i am here with only dust and lasers and me alone” - teraz sobie wyobraz motyw music video (w sumie klasyczny), gdzie jest ujecie masywnego „sztucznego” nawet koncertu z masa ludzi dymu i laserow i w momencie jak to mowie to wszystko zamienia sie w pustke i ciemnosc z laserami w pyle

Spowity w lasery na 8 osiach i uniemozliwiajace ruch. przycierajace czasem ubranie i ciało
