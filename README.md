## Lyrics

```
"Let's just take a moment here.
Let's just take a fucking moment!"

Ayee

[HOOK]
Feeling wrong with all the words been spitting out
Fleeting thoughts are the swarms I've been calling down
Give it up I've told myself perhaps a thousand times
Counting blows like they are mine

[VERSE]
Feeling wrong with all the words been spitting out yeah
Fleeting thoughts are the swarms I've been calling down (to?)
Give it up I've told myself perhaps a thousand times yeah 
Counting blows like they are mine, no intentions to put up 
Truth be told lack of progress is what scares me most
Leading home another kind of route I'm taking off 
the road so long as you don't listen, you just cope yeah
Feeding hope wasn't all that wise - nope

[CHORUS]
Now I get to know the new horizons - such a trope arises
All was sort of well before you came along (truth)
Glad I lied to myself I was wrong (wrathed?) (capped)
Now I realize I am here with only dust and lasers and me alone (MELODY)
In my head, always there, always sorta broke but strong
Bowing head up in arms, destitute but (for) gold
Turning rage into cold (brew) 
Ain't rich (ain't shit)(ain't a thing) according to y'all but that's fine (allright)
Coz (it) that ain't my mode of thought - at all (lower)

[VERSE]
Look at you all serene during calm before the storm
Shadow's near, the double thong 
i just think it's wrong 
You think my morals gone, you think so, 
fine - i think they just refined
feeling somewhere in my heart 
Maybe try to actually speak sometimes if you think communication was wrong
lost the mask (in red)
Coalitions and fake support - what's that?
You prolly be suprised with what you're missing out
Putting all on trust and actually righting wrongs
That would catch you minding other people souls? (emotions)
Looking for sublime manifesting trance with bass
lasers they define the rhymes precise (lasers be like rhymes) disasters
i devise perspectives colorized when many clash with one
slicing through the core with gracious dance

[HOOK]
Feeling wrong with all the words been spitting out yeah
Fleeting thoughts are the swarms I've been calling down (to?)
Give it up I've told myself perhaps a thousand times yeah 
Counting blows like they are mine, no intentions to put up 

[VERSE]
Feeling wrong with all the words been spitting out yeah

Truth be told lack of progress is what scares me most
Leading home another kind of route I'm taking off 
the road so long as you don't listen, you just cope yeah
Feeding hope wasn't all that wise - nope

[CHORUS]
Now I get to know the new horizons - such a trope
All was sort of well before you came along  (so)
Glad I lied to myself I was wrong (wrathed?)
Now I realize (?) I am here (in red) -with- only dust and lasers and me alone
In my head, always there, always sorta broke but strong
Bowing head up in arms, destitute but gold
Turning rage into cold (brew) 
Ain't rich (ain't shit) according to y'all but that's fine 
Coz (it) that ain't my mode of thought (at all)





What inside you can't see is the prize
Maybe take just a peek sometimes

Turns out I was a wolf in disguise yeah
Took me bloody years to figure that out yeah
Fool blinded by the light i was (i was)


Oh I know I've put barriers against my better judgement
Trying out but those new facade —  aaah
moment passed, made me feel like i need to atone

...

need another half - no repeating, just narrative

```

## Notes

## Music Video

Definicja Hitech Crime: „now i realize i am here with only dust and lasers and me alone” - teraz sobie wyobraz motyw music video (w sumie klasyczny), gdzie jest ujecie masywnego „sztucznego” nawet koncertu z masa ludzi dymu i laserow i w momencie jak to mowie to wszystko zamienia sie w pustke i ciemnosc z laserami w pyle

Spowity w lasery na 8 osiach i uniemozliwiajace ruch. przycierajace czasem ubranie i ciało
